1. Use same level hardware for the machines.
Otherwise perfernace decreate by the lowest one
and hard to config host, and start cmd.

2 windows os dose not work well with connections

3 all machine use same copy or spark files.  Some dependency , like guava has to change to version 19.0

4.    a. I have 3 dse running cassandra. I found this machine query is very slow
      b. I guess dse02  spark only access dse02 cassandra, because dse02 spark  accumulator always gives 2, but I have 18 record
      actually. Then I found that my dse02 cassandra only have 2 record
      c. when running application on cluster , in accumualtor only see dse03 contribute 11 , but didnot show how many dse02 contributed
5 spark cassandra connection point cannot be set at runtime.
